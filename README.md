# **LLM - Turkish Medicine Interaction Evaluator**

This project is a model built using the HuggingFace `transformers` library to evaluate potential health risks and chronic diseases resulting from drug interactions. The model is fine-tuned using a custom dataset, focusing on the evaluation of drug and disease interactions in Turkish.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to create a model capable of assessing the potential health risks and identifying chronic diseases that may arise when certain medications are combined. The model uses a specialized dataset and employs LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning.

## **Key Features**

- **Turkish Language Support:** The model processes and generates responses in Turkish.
- **Drug Interaction Evaluation:** The model evaluates interactions between different medications and their potential side effects.
- **Chronic Disease Identification:** The model identifies chronic diseases that could arise from medication combinations.
- **Custom Dataset:** A custom dataset is used for training the model, consisting of medical questions and answers related to drug interactions and chronic diseases.
- **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** The model uses LoRA for more efficient fine-tuning with fewer parameters, reducing computational costs.
